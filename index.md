## About Me
My name is Shayan Riyaz and I am a Software Engineer by profession. Currently, I am a Software Engineering fellow at <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/" target="_blank">Major League Hacking </a> 
and a part of the technical content developer team at <a href="https://www.bitproject.org/" target="_blank">Bit Project</a>.

I started my Academic journey when I moved from [Karachi, Pakistan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-H5Gx4aWQk) to the United States of America. I studied Mathematics, Physics and Programming at  <a href="https://www.bitproject.org/" target="_blank">De Anza College</a> in Cupertino, CA. At De Anza College I started of with pure Physics and Mathematics, used that knowledge to study a little bit of Robotics and Mechanics. Eventually my experience with microcontrollers and other electronic hardware drew me to Electrical Engineering, which I chose at my field of study at <a href="https://www.csulb.edu/" target="_blank"> California State Univerity, Long Beach</a> graduating with a B.S in 2019.<br />


Previously, I worked at as a research assistant at<a href="http://web.csulb.edu/~edemirca/hprl.html" target="_blank"> CSULB</a>
and as a Engineering intern at<a href="https://www.vectracom.com/" target="_blank"> VectraCom</a> in Karachi, Pakistan.

### Advice 
For those who are not sure about which field they want to specialize in, for example in my case, I knew my work was related to practical sciences but I wasn't sure if it would be related to Physics, Mathematics and Engineering. Starting at a Community College provided me the opporunity to get a taste of each of these fields from an early point of my Bachelors.

## Pivoting towards Software Engineering
While in my 3rd year of Electrical Engineering (Spring 2018), I was introduced to TensorFlow 1.0 and the concept of Deep Learning. Out of curiosity I dived into Machine Learning methods and their application inthe real world. One thing lead to another and fell in love with writing software. What is more important to me is consistently experimenting both with hardware and software to creat projects that incoroporate:
- Good software practices (backend communication).
- Robust Data pipelines for the hardware design.
