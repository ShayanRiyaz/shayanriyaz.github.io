## About Me
I am a Software and Research Development Engineer by profession with an interest in algorithm engineering . I have worked as an ***Algorithm Engineer*** at <a href="https://www.masimo.com/" target="_blank">Masimo</a>. My work there has revolved designing real-time algorithms for Biomedical devices fusing Inertial Measurment Units (IMU), Photoplethysmography (PPG),Phonocardiogram (PCG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors using Digital Signal Processing, Machine/Deep Learning and Bayesian Modeling. 

Some of the projects at Masimo Include:
* <a href="https://www.masimo.com/products/continuous/radius-vsm/" target="_blank">W1</a>
* <a href="https://www.masimo.com/products/sensors/centroid/" target="_blank">Centroid</a>
* <a href="https://www.masimo.com/products/continuous/radius-vsm/" target="_blank">Radius VSM</a>

I have previously contributed as an Open Source Developer at <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/" target="_blank">Major League Hacking </a> and as Technical Content Developer and Project Lead at <a href="https://www.bitproject.org/" target="_blank">Bit Project</a>. As an Undergraduate, I conducted research in Haptic Feedback and IMU based Musculoskeletal modeling as a research assistant at<a href="http://web.csulb.edu/~edemirca/hprl.html" target="_blank"> CSULB</a> and as an engineering intern at<a href="https://www.vectracom.com/" target="_blank"> VectraCom</a> in Karachi, Pakistan.

<br>

I studied Mathematics, Physics and Programming at <a href="http://deanza.edu/" target="_blank">De Anza College</a> in Cupertino, CA. At De Anza College I started of with pure Physics and Mathematics and eventually gained enough intuition to study Robotics. Eventually my experience with microcontrollers and software design drew me to Electrical Engineering, which I chose as my field of study at <a href="https://www.csulb.edu/" target="_blank"> California State Univerity, Long Beach</a> graduating with a B.S in 2019. 
<br>
## Current Interests
I am studying the following topics:
* Artifical Intelligence (Machine/Deep Learning)
* Signal Processing
* Causal Modeling 
* Systems Engineering for Biomedical Devices
