        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an engineer by profession with an interest in algorithms (classical and AI), data engineering and system architecture. I am currently working as a <strong>Software Engineer in R&D</strong> at <a href="https://www.stroke-dx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeuraNova</a>. My work revolves around designing end-to-end (data collection experiment design to algorithm deployment) products to detect ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. My work spans both long term development internal research tools and algorithms for on device inference.</p>

        <h2>Past Experiences</h2>
        <h3>Industry</h3>
        <p>I previously have worked as an <em><strong>Algorithm Engineer</strong></em> at <a href="https://www.masimo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Masimo</a>. My work there has revolved designing real-time algorithms for Biomedical devices fusing Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), Photoplethysmography (PPG), Phonocardiogram (PCG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors using Digital Signal Processing, Machine/Deep Learning and Bayesian Modeling.</p>

        <p>Some of my projects at Masimo Include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.masimo.com/products/continuous/radius-vsm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W1</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.masimo.com/products/sensors/centroid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centroid</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.masimo.com/products/continuous/radius-vsm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radius VSM</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <p>I have previously:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contributed as an Open Source Developer at <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Major League Hacking</a>.</li>
          <li>Technical Content Developer and Project Lead at <a href="https://www.bitproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bit Project</a>.</li>
          <li>Undergraduate, research assistant at <a href="http://web.csulb.edu/~edemirca/hprl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HPRL</a> under <a href="https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-engineering/dr-emel-demircan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Emel Demircan</a>. <em>There I conducted research in Haptic Feedback and IMU based Musculoskeletal modeling</em>.</li>
          <li>Engineering intern at <a href="https://www.vectracom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VectraCom</a> in Karachi, Pakistan.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Primarily my experience with microcontrollers and software design drew me to Electrical Engineering, which I chose as my field of study at <a href="https://www.csulb.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California State University, Long Beach</a> graduating with a B.S in 2019.</p>
        <p>Before that I studied Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science at <a href="http://deanza.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">De Anza College</a> in Cupertino, CA.</p>

        <h3>Current Interests</h3>
        <p>I am studying the following topics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Artificial Intelligence (Machine/Deep Learning)</li>
          <li>Signal Processing</li>
          <li>Causal Modeling</li>
          <li>Systems Engineering for Biomedical Devices</li>
        </ul>
