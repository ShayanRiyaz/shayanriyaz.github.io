I grew up being fascinated by the technology around me. After I got my first arduino, I would spend hours trying to understand C. I had alot of fun doing that and decided that Engineering/ Software is where I want to be.

### Projects

* [Digital History Curriculum](https://github.com/bitprj/DigitalHistory)<br>
An Open-Source introductory data science curriculum for people with a Non-Techincal Background. This curriculum is currently being implemented in the Humanties College at California State University, Fullerton

* [Drowsy Detector](https://github.com/ShayanRiyaz/Drowsy-Detector)<br>
A drowsy detector for drivers on long trips. If the camera detects drowsiness it quickly alerts the user and suggests rest stops or gas stations opening nearby.

* [Rex Run](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/Rex-Run)<br>
A low budget endless runner made during a hackathon sprint.

### Workshops
* [Introduction to Data Science](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ShayanRiyaz/My-Technical-Workshops/blob/master/Introductory-Data-Science-Workshop/BitUniversity-Workshop.ipynb) <br>
A simple easy to follow introduction to programming for data science/analysis. The topics covered are `Python`, DataFrames with `Pandas` and A tutorial using the **Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade** [dataset](https://www.slavevoyages.org/).

* [Introduction to Robotics and Deep learning](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ShayanRiyaz/My-Technical-Workshops/blob/master/Deep-Learning-Robotics-Workshop/Deep-Learning-and-Robotics-Presentation.ipynb#scrollTo=xhpt8Y9Zz9TM) <br>
This workshop talks about implementing Deep learning on Inertial Measurment Unit (IMU) data in order to classify gestures and using the model in Unity 3D. Topics covered are data processing, Feeding Data to a Neural Network and evaluating models. The dataset used can be foun [here](https://github.com/ShayanRiyaz/My-Technical-Workshops/tree/master/Deep-Learning-Robotics-Workshop/data).
